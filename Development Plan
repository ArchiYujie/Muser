Muser Development Plan
Key words: node js, spotify api, rest API, android app 


Backend
backend will be built in node js. We are considering using sequelize and one type of relational database (MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, etc.). 

The backend development will involve database design (schema design), database orm implementation, writing all the necessary controllers, services and routers, config setup. The backend will provide the API call, which will be utilized by future web gui and mobile apps. 

Likely machine learning data calculation features will be coded in Python. So the idea is that we’ll create a number of python processes for these calculations. Node Js can spawn Python processes. Also we can run Python processes and store the data in the database. 

The backend code and database storage will be hosted by Amazon AWS. We’ll first use free tiers vm. Later we’ll move to some larger vms which have some cost. 

Web Control Center
We’ll need to build a admin dashboard, where admin users will view all the users’ profiles and status. There will be some analytics embedded in the dashboard. The dashboard will have the ability to generate diagrams and admins are able to view these diagrams, which helps visualize the patients’ progress. 

It’s better we have the web control center monitor all the Python processes and our machine learning calculations.
